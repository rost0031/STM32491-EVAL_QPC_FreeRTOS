/**
 * @file    I2C1DevMgr.h
 * @brief   Declarations for functions for the I2C1DevMgr AO.
 * This state machine handles any device that is attached to the I2C1 bus.
 * This AO doesn't handle the low level I2C commands and instead communicates
 * with I2CBusMgr AO to send the events that kick off the low level I2C cmds.
 * The rationale behind this is that different I2C devices require different
 * I2C commands in different order.  Some EEPROMs request 2 Start bits, some
 * other devices have different timeouts for their write/read commands. This
 * way, the I2C bus logic can stay common and any device differences are
 * handled in the device specific AOs.
 *
 * @note 1: If editing this file, please make sure to update the I2C1DevMgr.qm
 * model.  The generated code from that model should be very similar to the
 * code in this file.
