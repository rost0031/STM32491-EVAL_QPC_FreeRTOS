\endcode

\li (1) Every QP version, such as QP/C, QP/C++, ir QP-nano resides in the
separate directory branch, called henceforth QP Root Directory. The essential
element of the design is that the QP Root Directory can be "plugged into" any
branch of a hierarchical file system and you can move the QP Root Directory
around, or even have multiple versions of the QP Root Directories. You can
also freely choose the name of the QP Root Directory, although I recommend the
directory names \c qpc\\ for QP/C and \c qpcpp\\ for QP/C++. The ability to
relocate the QP Root Directory means that only relative paths should be used
in the Makefiles, build scripts, workspaces, or project files.

\li (2) The file qpc.chm contains the "QP/C Reference Manual" in CHM format.

\li (3) The \c doxygen\\ directory contains this "QP/C Reference Manual"
generated with the Doxygen utility.

\li (4) The \c html\\ subdirectory contains this HTML verions of the "QP/C
Reference Manual". In particular, the file index.html is the index page of the
Manual.

\li (5) The \c examples\\ directory contains the application examples that are
included in the standard QP/C distribution. The structure of the \c examples\\
(and also \c ports\\ directory) is the most complicated because of the large
number of choices available, such as CPU architectures, compilers, operating
systems, and compiler options. Each of those choices is represented as a
separate level of nesting in a hierarchical directory tree, so that each
dimension in the multi-dimensional space of options can be extended
independently from the others. Also, the directory branch for each QP port is
individually customizable, so each branch can represent only choices relevant
for a given CPU, operating system, compiler, etc.

\li (6) The CPU architecture is placed as the first level of nesting within
the \c examples\\ directory. Examples of CPU architectures are: 80x86, ARM,
ARM Cortex, AVR, MSP430, M16C, etc. Please note that a separate directory
is needed whenever the CPU architecture is significantly different. For
example, even though the traditional ARM and the new ARM Cortex are
related, the differences are significant enough to require a separate
directory branch for ARM and ARM Cortex.

\li (7) The second level of nesting, under the CPU architecture, is the
operating system used. For example, in the 80x86 architecture, QP can operate
under DOS (with the "vanilla" cooperative kernel), under the QK preemptive
kernel, under the MicroC/OS-II RTOS, or under Linux (and perhaps other OSs,
such as Win32).

\note The ordering of directory levels reflects the embedded focus in the QP
design. In most standalone QF applications the CPU architecture is typically
more important than the RTOS/OS. For general-purpose operating systems, such
as Linux, the reversed order (operating system at a higher level than the CPU
architecture) would perhaps feel more natural.

\li (8) The next level of nesting, under each operating system directory, is
the directory for the compiler used. For example, the DOS port can be compiled
with the Open Watcom or perhaps with Borland C++. Similarly, the port
to ARM Cortex with QK kernel can be compiled with the IAR, RealView, or GNU
compilers.

\li (9) In some ports, the compiler can emit code for various modes of the
CPU. For example, a compiler for 80x86 under DOS can produce small, compact,
large, or huge memory models. These different modes result in incompatible
object code, and therefore each of them requires a separate branch. Please
note that the compiler options level is optional. For example, the ARM Cortex
CPU branch does not need the compiler options level.

\li (10) Finally, the example application is located in its own directory. For
example, the \c dpp\\ directory contains the "Dining Philosopher Problem"
application example for this particular CPU/Kernel/Compiler/Options
combinations.

\li (11) The \c dpp\\dbg\\ subdirectory contains the object files and the
executable for the Debug configuration.

\li (12) The \c dpp\\rel\\ subdirectory contains the object files and the
executable for the Release configuration.

\li (13) The \c dpp\\spy\\ subdirectory contains the object files and the
executable for the Spy configuration (with the \ref qs_page).

\li (14) All five state designed patterns described in Chapter 5 of \ref
PSiCC2 (PSiCC2) are provided.

\li (15) The directory \c qk\\ contains examples for the QK preemptive kernel.

\li (16) The directory \c ucos2\\ contains examples for the MicroC/OS-II RTOS.

\li (17) The directory \c linux\\ contains examples for the Linux operating
system.

\note The port to Linux also runs on many POSIX-compliant OSes/RTOSes, such as
BSD, Solaris, MacOS X, and QNX.

\li (18) The Makefile for building POSIX port is provided.

\li (19) The directory \c arm-cortex\\ contains QP examples for ARM Cortex.

\li (20) The directory \c include\\ contains platform-independent header files
for QP all components. You need to point your C/C++ compiler to include files
from this directory.

\li (21-24) The platform-independent source code of each QP component is
located in the separate directory. The sources files are only needed to
re-build QP libraries, but you don't need to include these directories in the
compiler's search path to build applications.

\li (25) The directory \c ports\\ contains platform-dependent header files and
libraries to be used by QP applications. This directory structure is the most
complicated because of the large number of choices available, such as CPU
architectures, compilers, operating systems, and compiler options. Each of
those choices is represented as a separate level of nesting in a hierarchical
directory tree, so that each dimension in the multi-dimensional space of
options can be extended independently from the others. Also, the directory
branch for each port is individually customizable, so each branch can
represent only choices relevant for a given CPU, operating system, compiler,
etc.

\li (26) The CPU architecture is placed as the first level of nesting within
the \c ports\\ directory. Examples of CPU architectures are: 80x86, ARM Cortex,
ARM, AVR, MSP430, M16C, etc. Please note that a separate directory is needed
whenever the CPU architecture is significantly different. For example, even
though the traditional ARM and the new ARM Cortex are related, the
differences are significant enough to require a separate directory branch for
ARM and ARM Cortex.

\li (27) The second level of nesting, under the CPU architecture, is the
operating system used. For example, in the 80x86 architecture, QP can operate
under DOS (with the "vanilla" cooperative kernel), under the QK preemptive
kernel, under the MicroC/OS-II RTOS, or under Linux (and perhaps other OSs,
such as Win32).

\note The ordering of directory levels reflects the embedded focus in the QP
design. In most standalone QF applications the CPU architecture is typically
more important than the RTOS/OS. For general-purpose operating systems, such
as Linux, the reversed order (operating system at a higher level than the CPU
architecture) would perhaps feel more natural.

\li (28) The next level of nesting, under each operating system directory, is
the directory for the compiler used. For example, the DOS port can be compiled
with the Open Watcom or perhaps with Borland C++. Similarly, the port
to ARM Cortex with QK kernel can be compiled with the IAR, RealView, or GNU
compilers.

\li (29) In some ports, the compiler can emit code for various modes of the
CPU. For example, a compiler for 80x86 under DOS can produce small, compact,
large, or huge memory models. These different modes result in incompatible
object code, and therefore each of them requires a separate branch. Please
note that the compiler options level is optional. For example, the ARM Cortex
CPU branch does not need the compiler options level.

\li (30) Finally, the QP libraries can be compiled with different compile-time
switches and optimization options. For example, the \c dbg\\ directory holds
the Debug configuration, which contains the symbolic debug information.

\li (31) Each specific build directory contains the QP library files. The
actual library names should comply with the conventions used on a particular
platform. For example, on Linux the libraries are typically named \c libXXX.a
(e.g., \c libqep.a, \c libqf.a, etc.).

\li (32) The \c rel\\ directory holds the Release configuration, which
typically does not contain debug information but might use aggressive
optimizations for best performance.

\li (33) The standard QP ports often contain a simple \c make.bat script or a
Makefile for building all the QP libraries for the port. You typically can
choose the build configuration by providing a target to the make.bat script or
to the Makefile. The default target is "dbg". Other possible targets are
"rel", and "spy". The following table summarizes the targets accepted by the
make.bat scripts or the Makefiles.

\li (34) The qep_port.h header file contains platform-specific definitions of
macros and typedef's for the QEP component.

\li (35) The qf_port.h header file contains platform-specific definitions of
macros and typedef's for the QF component.

\li (36) The qk_port.h header file contains platform-specific definitions of
macros and typedef's for the QK component.

\li (37) The qs_port.h header file contains platform-specific definitions of
macros and typedef's for the QS component.

\li (38) The subdirectory \c ucos2.86\\ contains the headers and object files
of MicroC/OS-II v2.86, compiled for 80x86 with the Open Watcom compiler.
This directory is provided only to allow you re-building the example
applications based on the QF port to MicroC/OS-II. Typically, however, you
will need to obtain the MicroC/OS-II source code to re-build it for the actual
processor you're using.

\li (39-40) QP ports to an external RTOS or OS, such as MicroC/OS-II or Linux
